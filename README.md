## My process

### Built with

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/)
- SCSS
- Typescript
- Axios
- [@vueuse/core](https://vueuse.org/) - Composition API utilities library for Vue

### Continued development

Working with composition API to create reusable code is something I will continue to improve in order to make things more generic and reusable in other projects.
Creating well typed web apps is one of the core concepts that I would like to focus more in the future.

### Useful resources

- [@vueuse/core](https://vueuse.org/) - This helped me for events and simple things that I would have to implement from scratch everytime, such as `onScroll`, `onClickOutside` or `useClipboard`
- [Evite-plugin-auto-import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import) - This is an amazing vite plugin which helped me keeping my code clean, since it automatically imports for me everything I need from the libraries I use.
